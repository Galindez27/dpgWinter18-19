# Python Tic-Tac-Toe
## Overview

A simple python game with the intention of demonstrating object oriented programming. Implements features like operator overloading and attributes that make python OOP powerful.

## Goals

Make a playable game of tic tac toe on the command line.
~~<b>REACH:</b> Make a simple gui with point a click interaction.~~ -Tired of python, going to leave it as is.

##Notes

Originally started with the anaconda and spyder IDE as the enviroment, but switched to default python 3.7 running on command line as ther interface. <b>DOES NOT WORK WITH IPython CONSOLE. USE STANDARD COMMAND LINE. SEE BELOW</b>

Built/Tested with python 3.7.1, I cannot garuntee it will work with anything else, but will most likely work with later versions. 

##Instructions
1. Open or direct [cmd/powershell(Windows), terminal(linux/macOS)] to the Tic-Tac-Toe directory
2. type "py driver.py" to start
