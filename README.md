Daily Program Winter Break 2018/19

Simple Daily Programming repo. Plan to just get as far as I can on various sub projects in languages like C and Python. Maybe a new one too.

## Completed Projects
1. Python Tic-Tac-Toe
2. C++ Binary Tree

## Closing Remarks
Didn't get as much done as I originally thought, mainly got side tracked with a trip to MN and being with family over break, but still enjoyed making each.
